# Note that you can not call the function before it is has been defined,
# as would happen if you were to uncomment the following line.

# main()

# This is because at this time in the execution,
# the Python interpreter has not yet encountered the definition of the function.


def main():
    # If you want the output to look exactly like in the problem statement,
    # you want to use this:

    # run_like_hell_ehem_I_mean_run_like_samples()

    # But for running the program interactively,
    # you might want to do something like this:

    run_interactive()

    # Notice how we can define more than one function,
    # and call one function inside another function.
    # We can call functions defined below this line in the code,
    # because we're inside a function that was called
    # after the other functions were defined,
    # so Python has already set them up.

    # This is why we always want to call the main function at the very end of the file.


# If we call main() from here,
# then the other functions below do not exist yet,
# so although we are able to call main() itself,
# it would crash as soon as it tries to call one of the other functions.


# Feel free to rename this function.
# Just make sure to use the updated name also where you call the function.
